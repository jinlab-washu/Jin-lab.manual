 Github pipeline documentation is typically maintained on the github repo where we keep the code (CWL) for each pipeline,
 subworkflow and tool used: https://github.com/genome/analysis-workflows

 The wiki is the best place to start when looking for documentation on the CWL. Much of it is auto-generated, but there are 
 some pages for each pipeline that include process diagrams and high-level overviews:
