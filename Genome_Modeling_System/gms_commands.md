#### Disable configurations you don't need:
```
genome analysis-project disable-config-file --profile-item CONFIG_ID
```
**Disabling vs Inactivating Config Files

The difference between disable and inactive: disabled means "remove all analysis generated by this, I don't need it" vs. inactive means "I still need the resulting data from previous models, but don't make any new models" -jw

Re-process instrument data with new configuration file:

```genome analysis-project add-config-file --reprocess PROJ_ID NEW_CONFIG_YAML_FILE```

#### Abandon all builds and re-queue models

```genome model build abandon-and-queue --reason=disk_quota $ANALYSIS_PROJ_ID```

#### Get all failed builds for an analysis project

``` genome model.analysis_project.id=XXX,status=Failed```

#### Queue new builds for models

**This can happen when trying a new pipeline and the builds fail. See command below:**

 ```genome model build queue --reason 'added process_inputs.pl' MODELID```

#### Show configuration file location

```genome analysis-project show-config <ANALYSIS_PROJ_NAME/ID>```

#### Show genome models for an analysis project

```genome model list --show=id --filter "analysis_project.id=$analysis_ID"```

#### Find instrument data ids with library names

```genome instrument-data list --filter  "library.name ~ <Part of library names, e.g. KCM>"```

~ : "like" operator

#### Update an individual, e.g. changing their name:

```
genome individual update name --value=NAME --individual=ID
```

Where `NAME` is the name you would like to use and `ID` is the ID of the individual created previously.

#### Delete analyis-project and associated model data

- Mark the analysis project for deprecation

    ```genome analysis-project deprecate $ANALYSIS_PROJECT_ID```

   This marks the project so that no new builds can be built. 

    Currently, there is no automated process to delete cwl builds. Therefore, the data will have to be manually deleted by you, the user who created the project or a person from MGI. See below.

- Delete analysis project and model data

     If the analysis project was ran using the **prod-builder** environment, you will have to have someone from mgi delete the analysis-project model data for you. On the MGI Slack channel, send them the analysis project ids you would like the model data deleted for.
 
     If the project was ran using the **ad-hoc** environment, whomever created the project will have to delete it. If you created the analysis project, you will be able to delete the analysis-project and model data with the command/s below.
 
     To get a quick check of the builds that will be deleted, run the command:
 
     ```ANALYSIS_PROJECT_ID=a420e0496a14459594740b816b6f9479; genome model build list -f model.analysis_project.id=$ANALYSIS_PROJECT_ID --show id --nohead | xargs | tr ' ' '/' | xargs -I BUILD_IDS echo genome disk allocation purge --reason "deprecation of Analysis Project $ANALYSIS_PROJECT_ID" owner_id:BUILD_IDS```
     
     (this will echo the builds to be deleted back to the terminal)
 
     To actually delete the builds, run the command:
 
     ```ANALYSIS_PROJECT_ID=$ANALYSIS_PROJECT_ID genome model build list -f model.analysis_project.id=$ANALYSIS_PROJECT_ID --show id --nohead | xargs | tr ' ' '/' | xargs -I BUILD_IDS genome disk allocation purge --reason "deprecation of Analysis Project $ANALYSIS_PROJECT_ID" owner_id:BUILD_IDS```
     
     To determine the owner of the analysis project,
     
     ```genome model build list -f model.analysis_project.id=$ANALYSIS_PROJECT_ID --show run_by --nohead | sort | uniq -c```
