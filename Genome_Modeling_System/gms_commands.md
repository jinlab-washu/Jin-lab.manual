#### Disable configurations you don't need:
```
genome analysis-project disable-config-file --profile-item CONFIG_ID
```
**Disabling vs Inactivating Config Files

The difference between disable and inactive: disabled means "remove all analysis generated by this, I don't need it" vs. inactive means "I still need the resulting data from previous models, but don't make any new models" -jw

Re-process instrument data with new configuration file:

```genome analysis-project add-config-file --reprocess PROJ_ID NEW_CONFIG_YAML_FILE```

#### Abandon all builds and re-queue models

```genome model build abandon-and-queue --reason=disk_quota $ANALYSIS_PROJ_ID```

#### Get all failed builds for an analysis project

``` genome model.analysis_project.id=XXX,status=Failed```

#### Queue new builds for models

**This can happen when trying a new pipeline and the builds fail. See command below:**

 ```genome model build queue --reason 'added process_inputs.pl' MODELID```

#### Show configuration file location

```genome analysis-project show-config <ANALYSIS_PROJ_NAME/ID>```

#### Show genome models for an analysis project

```genome model list --show=id --filter "analysis_project.id=$analysis_ID"```

#### Find instrument data ids with library names

```genome instrument-data list --filter  "library.name ~ <Part of library names, e.g. KCM>"```

~ : "like" operator

#### Update an individual, e.g. changing their name:

```
genome individual update name --value=NAME --individual=ID
```

Where `NAME` is the name you would like to use and `ID` is the ID of the individual created previously.
